This repositry is split into two sections; based on two courseworks in the course. This first is on diffusion limited aggregation, and the second on the Ising model.

The exercises contain files used for weekly exercises.

This work is strictly my own and must be properly cited if used. This repositry contains files from the University of Bath PH30056 unit.
