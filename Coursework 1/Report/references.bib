@article{MeakinDLA2,
	abstract = {The diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model has become an important paradigm for non-equilibrium pattern formation and provides a basis for understanding a broad range of natural processes. Progress in the simulation and quantitative characterization of DLA clusters is described. Despite advances in this direction, and extensive theoretical studies, the DLA process and the scaling structure of DLA clusters are still not well understood. Clusters generated by the DLA model have a fractal geometry but it is not certain whether the asymptotic structure is self-similar or must be described by a more complex scaling model. Lattice anisotropy has a strong influence on the asymptotic shape of DLA clusters and the asymptotic stucture of DLA clusters with anisotropy (and noise reduction) is relatively well understood.},

@article{MeakinDLA,
	abstract = {Improved algorithms have been developed for both off-lattice and hypercubic lattice diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) in dimensionalities (d) 3-8 and for two-dimensional off-lattice DLA. In two-dimensional off-lattice DLA a fractal dimensionality (D) of about 1.71 was obtained for clusters containing up to 106 particles. This is significantly larger than the value of (d2+1)/(d+1) (5/3 for d = 2) predicted by mean field theories. For d > 2 the off-lattice simulations give results that are consistent with the mean field theories. For d = 3 and d = 4 the effects of lattice anisotropy can easily be seen for clusters containing 3 x 106 and 106 sites respectively and the effective fractal dimensionalities are slightly smaller for the lattice model clusters than for the off-lattice clusters. Results are also presented for two-, three- and four-dimensional lattice model clusters with noise reduction.},

@book{FractalsBook,
	abstract = {This lovely little book will take off and fly on its own power, but the author has asked me to write a few words, and one should not say no to a friend. Specific topics in fractal geometry and its applications have already benefited from several excellent surveys of moderate length, and gossip and preliminary drafts tell us that we shall soon see several monographic treatments of broader topics. For the teacher, however, these surveys and monographs are not enough, and an urgent need for more helpful books has been widely recognized. To write such a book is no easy task, but Jens Feder meets the challenge head on. His approach combines the old Viking's willingness to attack many difficulties at the same time, and the modern Norwegian's ability to achieve fine balance between diverging needs. lowe him special gratitude for presenting the main facts about R/ S analysis of long-run dependence; now a wide scientific public will have access to a large group of papers of mine that had until this day remained fairly confidential. Last but not least, we are all grateful to Jens for not having allowed undue personal modesty to deprive us of accounts of his own group's varied and excellent work. He did not attempt to say everything, but what he said is just fine. Benoit B. Mandelbrot Physics Department, IBM Thomas J.},
