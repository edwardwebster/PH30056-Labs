## Diffusion Limited Aggregation

Resources for DLA Simulation. DLA-Single was the standard code used. The other flavours are described below. The folder [Data](/Data) contains the python code used to analyse data in the form of jupyter notebooks.

### [DLA-3D](/DLA-3D)
Simulation of DLA in three dimensions. Has not been updated as the higher number of dimensions created memory allocation errors which I didn't have time to resolve.
---

### [DLA-Single](/DLA-Single)
Default code. Built in cmake and accepted parameters as command line inputs. As such, it could be called from python and output to the console used for data analysis. All particles are singularly generated and non-interacting.
Contains maximum functionality.
---

### [DLA](/DLA)
Same as DLA-Single but with many non-interacting particles. Further developments would have allowed particles to interact
---

### [Provided](/PH30056)
Code provided by A.Souslov and V.Rimpilainen as part of PH30056 Computational Physics B. Code is designed for MacOS.
